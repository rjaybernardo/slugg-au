Offset units are generated by projects that reduce, remove or capture emissions from the atmosphere such as reforestation, renewable energy or energy efficiency. For example, a project may reduce emissions by changing the timing of savanna burning in Northern Australia or capture emissions by re-vegetating a large area of land. One carbon credit is issued for each tonne of emissions avoided, removed or captured from the atmosphere. While carbon offset projects prevent, reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions from being released into the atmosphere - that's not all they do. Often these projects have other benefits such enhanced biodiversity, habitat protection, creating employment, helping people to live and work on country, improving health and education, and providing access to clean and affordable energy.\"<\/p>"}},"165966732203a2f998-2":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"What offset initiatives do you support?","answer":"<p>Our carbon credits support the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tasmanenvironmental.com.au\/offset-projects\/wind\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Winds of Change<\/em><\/a> initiative<em>.<\/em>Our products are manufactured in Asia, so we decided to support the<em>Winds of Change<\/em>iniative as it will directly improve the lives of the people who handmake of products.Across Asia, wind and solar farms introduce clean energy to the grid, which coal-fired power stations would otherwise generate.
